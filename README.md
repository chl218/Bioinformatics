## 00) Finding Hidden Messages in DNA

- Investigate DNA replication, and ask the question, where in the genome does DNA replication begin?
- Examine a different biological question, when we ask which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks. The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm, but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?
- Apply randomized algorithms, which roll dice and flip coins in order to solve problems.
- Find recurring biological motifs within genes that are responsible for helping Mycobacterium tuberculosis go "dormant" within a host for many years before causing an active infection
